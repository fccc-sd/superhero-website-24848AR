            Another one of issacs main enemies are Unitologists. they are a cult like group that worship the marker and belive that all the death thats spreading because of it
            is a devine choice and belive its the next step in humanities evolution. They try to hunt and kill Isaac because hes sofar the only person to destroy markers.
