  <h2>Isaacs whole life story.</h2>
  <h6>Spoilers ahead</h6>
<p> Isaac Clark was born on June 5, 2461, to Octavia and Paul Clark. His father was an engineer, but evetually became absent due to work. which inevitably caused Octavia to join the Church of Unitology to cope. She had ended up selling their estate to the church which inturn caused Isaac to hate Unitology.
    When he decided to follow in his fathers footsteps, that meaning becomeing an engineer, specifically a ship systems engineer for the concordanence Extraction corperation. His job had eventually led him to being apart of the USG Kellion in an emergency response team to a distress call to CEC's pride and joy, the USG Ishimura.
     One of the main reasons Isaac joined the team was to find his girlfriend, Nicole Brennen that he  urged on to join aboard the Ishimura before it was put out of commission. When they arrived, disaster struck as they are stranded in a space ship full of things that were once the crew of the ship now turned into grotesque, mutated corpses reanimated by the markers signal.
    After Isaac became the Sole survivor of the Ishimura, he was left stranded in space. three weeks after the destruction of the Aegis VII colony, Isaac was found when he was found by an EarthGov recovery patrol team led by Captain Maxmilian Reindhardt and Xander Sklar. After he was brought back to Titan station known as the Sprawl, he was used as a subject for project Telomere.
     When the marker on Aegis VII implimented its construction code into Isaacs mind, his mind, or he knew how to reconstruct the marker, and to make more markers. EarthGov scientists, led by Director Hans Tiedemann extracted those very codes from his mind. 
     Once Isaac fights his way through the Sprawl and destroyes the Black Marker, which inevitably destroys Titan Station, he along with a new ally Ellie Langford escape the destruction of the facility.</p>
