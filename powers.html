<p>In the four main installments of dead space, also includingn the remake, Isaac, among other people mostly have the same "powers". Since hes an engineer, the Engineering RIG would have these abilities to make repairs much easier and safer.
    Security personel are also given these enhancments for obvious reasons. to start off, theres Stasis. This is a core function of gameplay and the game would not be beatable without it. The Stasis module is time dilation technology implemented into the suits and is rechargable via other chatge modules, 
    or wall recharge stations. It along with other equipment can be used over and over. Stasis is a module implented into the suit that alows the wearer to fire an orb that when in contact, will slow down whataver was hit by it depending on how long the Stasis lasts.</p>

<p> The second ability Isaac utilizes during his time is kinesis. Its an important tool for survival, solving puzzles, and as a weapon. Its a gravity altering tool that work on inanimate objects. it also just so happens to work with firing bladed necromorph limbs around. 
    How it works is it emmits a slight white tractor beam that creates an artifical gravity feild around said object, allowing for easier movement and usage.</p>
