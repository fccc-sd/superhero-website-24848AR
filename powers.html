<h2><strong>Powers/Enhancments</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Stasis Module</strong></h3>
<p> In the four main installments of Dead Space, also including the remake, Isaac, among other people, mostly have the same "powers". Since he's an engineer, the Engineering RIG would have these abilities to make repairs much easier and safer. 
    Security personnel are also given these enhancements for obvious reasons. To start off, there's Stasis. This is a core function of gameplay and the game would not be beatable without it. 
    The Stasis module is time dilation technology implemented into the suits and is rechargeable via other charge modules, or wall recharge stations. It along with other equipment can be used over and over. Stasis is a module implemented into the suit that allows the wearer to fire an orb that when in contact, will slow down whatever was hit by it depending on how long the Stasis lasts.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong>Kinesis Module</strong></h3>
<p> The second ability Isaac utilizes during his time is kinesis. It's an important tool for survival, solving puzzles, and as a weapon. It's a gravity altering tool that works on inanimate objects. It also just so happens to work with firing bladed necromorph limbs around.
    How it works is it emits a slight white tractor beam that creates an artificial gravity field around said object, allowing for easier movement and usage. This allows for objects not directly next to Isaac to be used for whatever it's needed for. It also helps when heavy objects need to move, the gravity field allows for it to be moved, as long as it has the space to be moved.
    this power can be very dangerous on the other hand, pun intended. The Kineses module allows for item propulsion, meaning you can fire the held item at high velocity, which could be very unsafe and extremely dangerous, only if it's used wrong. Being able to pick up bladed limbs and fire them back at hostile enemies causing mediocre to severe damage.
    The Kinesis module is equippable to all people if they have a suit for it, Isaac finds the Kinesis module on a table somewhere on the USG Ishimura

<h3><strong>RIG</strong></h3>
<p> The next ability isn't really an ability, more so of a health system. All Suits have a RIG (Resource Integration Gear) is funnily enough, a health bar. It is charged and synced with the users own Bio sighs via connection to their nervous system and displays their physical state via a Blue bar projector on their back and on their wrist. There are many iterations of the RIG design but in my personal opinion, the Engineering suit's RIG looks the best.
    All civilians are given a RIG, but it's not that much. All it displays is health on the spine. People who work in more risk viable jobs such as engineering, medical, or security get Higher duty RIGs. In nearly all cases, RIGs are also considered as the suits, with engineering and Mining RIGS are equipped with Kinesis and Stasis modules, but security and other related RIGS have higher armor and combat enhancements. The medpacks that can be found laying around contain nano bots that can quickly stabilize the injuries someone has on their person.
    All RIGs have one related feature with one another, which is extremely helpful for those that tend to get lost easily (me).

<h3><strong>The Locator</strong></h3>
<p> the final useful power or enhancent, or whatever you call it, is called "The locator". All RIGs are equipped with it and its simply put, a on the go GPS. To be specific, its a standard, pre implimented feature of the RIG that will project a colored hologram towards your destination, it works in all enviorments regardless of if its in space, or in a dark place. 
    Its also useful incase of emergencies like if a necromorph outbreak were to happen, then it could be used to safly-ish navigate places without risking using comprimised, or inactive communication servers. Its overall a very useful tool to use and ensures people of varying occupations get to where they need to be.
