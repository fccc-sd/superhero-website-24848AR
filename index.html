<h3> Dead Space 3</h3>
    <p> Dead space three was the third and final installment to the series, while also being the longest and most action packed. It was released February 5, 2013 onto Xbox Cloud Gaming, Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation. The third game, while still being good, is generally seen as less than the first two games because the third game really isn't horror, it's more action shooter.
        The first game Issac never talked, once. It was claustrophobic, dark, and eerie. The second game was brighter and less claustrophobic, and Isaac started having voice lines, and some other core gameplay mechanics were changed, there were many more cutscenes. The third and final installment was more intense, more action oriented, co-op, and brighter among new features in the gameplay. two weeks after the Sprawl, Isaac is forced to help Sergeant John Carver and Captain Robert Norton to find a previous ally, "Ellie Langford"
        as she has disappeared in her pursuit to find the origin and destroy the markers once and for all. They knew their mission would be hard, but they didn't expect Unitologists to make it so difficult. The Church of Unitology is a cult-like religion that worships and believes what the marker says is true and believes the marker will push humanity to its next evolution. When Isaac and the team crash land onto the frozen planet known as
        "Tau Volantis", they have to battle multiple threats, The Necromorphs, Unitologists, and the harsh weather.

<h3>Dead space (2023) </h3>
    <p> When everything died down, ten years later another Dead Space was announced. Its not a fourth installment rather its a remake/remaster of the first installment. Dead Space(2023) is the newest installment to the franchise as a whole, with a lot of the same core mechanics as the first and second game. The atmosphere was reimagined and it's a lot like the original first game.
        It's claustrophobic, dark, eerie, but it's revamped due to the quality difference of a modified engine called "RenderWare engine" compared to the remasters engine, "Frostbite Engine".
