<p> Dead space three was the third and final installment to the series, while also being the longest and most action packed. it was released feburary 5, 2013 onto Xbox Cloud Gaming, Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation. the third game while still being good, is generaly seen as less than the first two games because the third game really isnt horror, its more action shooter. The first game Issac never talked, once. It was claustrophobic, dark, and earie. The second game was brighter and less claustrophobic, and Isaac started talking, there were many more cutscenes.  </p>
